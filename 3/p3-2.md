1练习使用CSV模块

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
Your task is to process the supplied file and use the csv module to extract data from it.
The data comes from NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) website. Each file
contains information from one meteorological station, in particular - about amount of
solar and wind energy for each hour of day.

Note that the first line of the datafile is neither data entry, nor header. It is a line
describing the data source. You should extract the name of the station from it.

The data should be returned as a list of lists (not dictionaries).
You can use the csv modules "reader" method to get data in such format.
Another useful method is next() - to get the next line from the iterator.
You should only change the parse_file function.

        name = reader.next()[1]
        reader.next()
        for row in reader:
            data.append(row)
 
    # Do not change the line below
    return (name, data)


def test():
    datafile = os.path.join(DATADIR, DATAFILE)
    name, data = parse_file(datafile)

    assert name == "MOUNTAIN VIEW MOFFETT FLD NAS"
    assert data[0][1] == "01:00"

3练习整理JSON

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
This exercise shows some important concepts that you should be aware about:
- using codecs module to write unicode files
- using authentication with web APIs
- using offset when accessing web APIs

To run this code locally you have to register at the NYTimes developer site 
and get your own API key. You will be able to complete this exercise in our UI
without doing so, as we have provided a sample result. (See the file 
'popular-viewed-1.json' from the tabs above.)

Your task is to modify the article_overview() function to process the saved
file that represents the most popular articles (by view count) from the last
day, and return a tuple of variables containing the following data:
- labels: list of dictionaries, where the keys are the "section" values and
  values are the "title" values for each of the retrieved articles.
- urls: list of URLs for all 'media' entries with "format": "Standard Thumbnail"

All your changes should be in the article_overview() function. See the test() 
function for examples of the elements of the output lists.
The rest of functions are provided for your convenience, if you want to access
the API by yourself.
